# Courses
This repositry consists of all the code from the online courses that I have done.
Some of these assignments required me to add to the pre-existing code that the teachers had made, therefore not all of it is mine. 
This repositry will functions as a sort of journal where I can track my progress and see progession while also allowing me to get familiar with Git and Github.
