Finding for float calculations:
1. All instances of integers needed to be replaced with a float. 
This make sure the computer stores the number as a decimal otherwise it would store only the whole numbers.
2. Integer division (eg 7/3) produces 2 while float produces 2.3333. 
Integer inputs lead to integer outputs the same with floats. You also can't mix types.
3. Converting from int to float sets the decimal part to 0 while the other way removes any decimal parts.
4. Modulous doesn't work or make sense for floats since the decimal and the whole number 
are stored together. Also it wouldn't work for undefined remainders.
Therefore you must choose the appropriate datatype for your program.
