Represent as an undirected graph. Nodes being each piece of glass and the edges can represent a shared edge between glass pieces. 
Graph colouring would then be employed on the graph. Each colour is assigned a number, 1-9. It would be fed a start node, set it to current and assign it a number. All neighbour nodes are then assigned a number that is different from the currents number. The next node is selected in a DFS way and assigned as current 	Graph: Nodes represent domes and edges represent tunnels between domes. 
Breadth first search could be used to count the depth of the route. The max depth is then found. 	priority queue. Video and audio calls will have priority to be received. Otherwise time of arrival will determine order. 	while incomplete is not empty

When a task has a priority attached to it, not just when it arrived. Including priority emails and space rover task lists. 	looking up in a list is O(n), since to find the last element in the list all other elements before it need to be considered. 
Lookup in a dictionary in O(1) since it only requires hashing then retrieval which in independent of input size. 
Therefore a dictionary is a better choice	a sorted array since dictionaries can't list things in order. Lists support sorting so they are preferred.
